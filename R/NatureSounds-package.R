#' AnimalSounds: Animal Sounds for Bioacustic Analysis
#' 
#' NatureSounds is a package containing a collection of example animal sounds for bioacoustic analysis.
#' The main goal is to provide example recordings to faciliate the development of bioacoustic 
#' tools in the R environment. When possible, selection tables with the time/frequency coordinates of the sounds 
#' in the example recordings will also be included. Note that this package does 
#' not contain any function. Check out the packages 'warbleR', 'tuneR' and 'seewave' 
#' for sound file manipulation and analysis in R.
