# NatureSounds

`NatureSounds` is a package containing a collection of example animal sounds for bioacoustic analysis. The main goal is to provide example recordings of animal sounds to faciliate the development of bioacoustic tools in the R environment. When possible, selection tables with the time/frequency coordinates of the sounds in the example recordings will also be included.


Install/load the package from CRAN as follows:

```r

# From CRAN would be
#install.packages("NatureSounds")
