`NatureSounds` is a package containing a collection of example animal
sounds for bioacoustic analysis. The main goal is to provide example
recordings of animal sounds to faciliate the development of bioacoustic
tools in the R environment. When possible, selection tables with the
time/frequency coordinates of the sounds in the example recordings will
also be included.

Install/load the package from CRAN as follows:

``` r
# From CRAN would be
install.packages("NatureSounds")

#load package
library(NatureSounds)
```

To install the latest developmental version from
[github](https://github.com/) you will need the R package
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

``` r
# From github
remotes::install_github("maRce10/NatureSounds")

#load package
library(NatureSounds)
```
